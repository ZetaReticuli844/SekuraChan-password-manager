# Sekura Chan - Password Manager

![Sekura Chan Logo](OIG.jpg)

Sekura Chan is a secure and user-friendly password manager built using Django. It allows you to store and manage multiple passwords in an encrypted format, ensuring your sensitive information remains safe. The application uses a PostgreSQL database to store the encrypted password entries, providing robust data security.

## Features

- **Password Encryption**: All passwords stored in Sekura Chan are encrypted to ensure maximum security and confidentiality.

- **Two-Factor Authentication**: To enhance security, Sekura Chan requires users to enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) through the settings menu. Once enabled, you'll be prompted to enter a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) code generated by your Google Authenticator app each time you log in.

- **Password Management**: Sekura Chan allows you to conveniently add, view, edit, and delete password entries. You can categorize and organize your passwords based on website names for easy retrieval.

- **Export Passwords**: You have the option to export all your password entries as a JSON file through the settings menu. This feature enables you to keep a backup of your passwords or migrate them to another password manager if needed.
